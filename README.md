# neovim config

This was froked from and based on the great ['kickstart.nvim'](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) starter.

## Installation

* Backup your previous configuration (if any exists)

### Git Clone Installation
* From a terminal cd/dir to:
    `~/.config/nvim` (Linux)
    `~/.config/nvim` (MacOS)
    `%userprofile%\AppData\Local\nvim\` (Windows)

* Run: `git clone https://github.com/royanger/kickstart.nvim.git ~/.config/nvim` OR: `gh repo clone royanger/kickstart.nvim`
* Run Neovim (from terminal or shortcut) and allow lazy.nvim to download files and set up the basics.
* Once the setup is complete, restart Neovim.
* **You're ready to go!**

Additional system requirements:
- Make sure to review the readmes of the plugins if you are experiencing errors. In particular:
  - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) is required for multiple [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim#suggested-dependencies) pickers.
- See [Windows Installation](#Windows-Installation) if you have trouble with `telescope-fzf-native`

### FAQ

* What should I do if I already have a pre-existing neovim configuration?
  * You should back it up, then delete all files associated with it.
  * This includes your existing init.lua and the neovim files in `~/.local` which can be deleted with `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
  * You may also want to look at the [migration guide for lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-migration-guide)
* What if I want to "uninstall" this configuration:
  * See [lazy.nvim uninstall](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-uninstalling) information

### Windows Installation

Installation may require installing build tools, and updating the run command for `telescope-fzf-native`

See `telescope-fzf-native` documentation for [more details](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim#installation)

This requires:

- Install CMake, and the Microsoft C++ Build Tools on Windows

```lua
{'nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim', build = 'cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build --config Release && cmake --install build --prefix build' }
```
